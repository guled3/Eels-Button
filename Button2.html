<div><ol>How they Look</ol>
    Depending on the species, eels can grow to be anywhere between 4 inches to 11 1/2 feet long. Even though eels look like snakes, their bodies usually do not have scales like snakes do and are smooth. 
    They have fins on their backs and on the tips of their tails and usually have pointed heads with sharp teeth. Eels that live deep in the sea are usually gray or black. 
    Eels that live in tropical areas have bright patterns and colors.
<ol>Where Eels Live</ol>
<li>Some eels live in places that have freshwater such as ponds, rivers and lakes. When they are ready to reproduce, they travel, or migrate, to the saltwater of oceans and seas. However, many eels live in saltwater at all times. Eels are found throughout the world. 
    They are bottom dwellers, which means that they usually can be found on the muddy or sandy floor of the river or ocean where they live.</li>

<ol>What Eels Eat</ol>
<li>Eels are carnivorous, meaning they are meat eaters. They eat a variety of animals such as worms, snails, frogs, shrimp, mussels, lizards and other small fish. They generally hunt for food at night.<li>
</li>
<ol>Most Common Eels</ol>
<li>Some of the most common eels are the conger and moray eels. Conger eels are marine animals; they only live in saltwater oceans and seas. There are more than 100 different types of conger eels, and they primarily live around the Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe. Conger eels can be up to 6 feet long and can weigh more than 100 pounds. They prefer to live in deep water and are blackish or grayish in color.

    The moray eel is the most widespread eel in the world and all of the species live in tropical seas. They inhabit shallow waters, and can be found in crevices among rocks or coral reefs. Moray eels have bright colors and skin patterns. 
    They are about 5 feet long, with the exception of one species that grows to 11 1/2 feet long. Humans often eat moray eels.</li>
